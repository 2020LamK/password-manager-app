# password-manager
Advanced Object-oriented Programming CSIS 3701

This was a personal project that used Android Studio in Java.
HIGHLY do not recommend using this app as an actual password manager (uses TextView instead of ListView/RecyclerView and does not encrypt).
  - this was just for me to gain hands on experience with the UI.

Improvements to this app may be made in the future (TBD).
